Hi Chuck,

I have cracked the SS286 / CP343 Mystery !!!

I sucessfully installed a standard Conner HDD in a supersport that
previously had a cp343 in it. The board was marked 3RE4B13500030C
in the silkscreen under the FDD. I presume that this is a rev C
motherboard.

I begged some schematics from the authorized service centre.

On schematic 11 they show a set of links marked "JVC" near an
undesignated HC08 chip. I determined that the Interupt requests
from the drive were not being serviced by the microprocessor. The
signal on pin 39, drive BUSY -active low, was being ANDED with the
IRQ request line hence NO interrupts by removing the AND gate
everything works o.k. (Pin 39 on the CP343 must be HIGH if BUSY).

The mods are not too bad. But you have to work on the surface mount
devices.

No components are required, just about 10 inches of wire wrap wire.

1) Remove the Motherboard from the case.

2) Locate the Connector CN15 cut the track leaving pin 25. Count
the pins very carefully. Solder a piece of wire wrap wire to pin
25. Feed the wire the hole beteen the legs of Q2. Solder the wire
to pin 1 of the IC12DB. (I don't know the reason for this mod. I
found it on a rev D motherboard).

3) Locate the IC 14F. This is an HC08. Lift pin 6 of the ic while
heating it with a fine soldering iron. Solder a piece of wire wrap
wire to pin 4 of 14F. Solder the other end of this wire to CN18 pin
14.

4) Insert Jumper JP28 if it is missing.

(Again I don't know the reason - I found it on a rev D.)
